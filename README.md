# Two-Wheeler Road Surface Classifier

Two-Wheeler Road Surface Classifier is an Android app that captures accelerometer and gyroscope data to classify road conditions for two-wheeler rides. It collects motion data and trains an LSTM model to classify surfaces like Kankar, Bitumen, and Concrete roads, plus speed breakers. The dataset can also help detect rash driving, enabling real-time safety alerts. üöÄüèçÔ∏è

## Statement

Create an Android App that captures the readings from motion sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope) in an android phone. Build a dataset using this application that contains the motion characteristics of an average person driving a two-wheeler. Build a LSTM classifier that takes any 3 second sample as input and classifies it as Kankar Road, Bitumen Road, Concrete Road, Single Speed Breaker and Multiple Speed Breakers.

**_Bonus:_** Can we use this dataset to generate alerts when a person is rash driving?

**_App Development with MIT App Inventor to Capture Sensor Data_**

We need an Android app to capture and save motion sensor readings. Use MIT App Inventor to collect data. MIT App Inventor is beginner-friendly but limited in advanced features.

**Steps:**

- Create a New Project: Go to MIT App Inventor, log in, and create a new project.
- Add Sensors: Add accelerometer and gyroscope components.
- Design the Interface: Create buttons for actions like ‚ÄúStart Recording‚Äù and ‚ÄúStop Recording.‚Äù
- Save Data: Use the TinyDB or File component to save sensor data locally in CSV format.
- Export Data: Add functionality to send the file to your computer using email or Google Drive or do it manually.

We can use MIT App Inventor for this part.

  <summary  style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold; display: flex; justify-content: center;">2. Data Collection & Compilation</summary>

**Prepare Your Environment:**

- Attach the phone securely to the two-wheeler.
- Select diverse routes (kankar, bitumen, concrete roads, etc.).

**Collect Data:**

- Start the app and record sensor readings while driving.
- Manually label the data or use a consistent annotation process during collection.

  <summary  style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold; display: flex; justify-content: center;">3. Dataset Labelling and Pre-processing</summary>
The Dataset has 9 colums which are as : "ID","SrNo","TimeStamp", "X_Acc","Y_Acc","Z_Acc","X_Gyro","Y_Gyro" and "Z_Gyro". Here instead of specifying the y label we have seperated the data or csv files of each classes to the respective folder i.e. "Bitumin","Concrete", "Kanker" and "Block".

  <summary  style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold; display: flex; justify-content: center;">4. Model Architecture</summary>
This model is a sequential neural network designed for multi-class classification tasks involving time series or sequential data. It starts with an LSTM layer of 64 units that returns sequences, followed by a dropout layer to prevent overfitting. A second LSTM layer with 32 units further processes the temporal patterns, again followed by dropout. The dense layer with 32 units and ReLU activation captures non-linear relationships, and the final softmax layer outputs probabilities across four classes. The batch size is "32" and epoch size is "50".

  <summary  style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold; display: flex; justify-content: center;">5. Model Training</summary>
The LSTM model is trained using the training data (X_train, y_train) over a maximum of 50 epochs with a batch size of 32. To avoid overfitting and improve generalization, an early stopping callback is used, which monitors the validation loss (val_loss). If the validation loss does not improve for 5 consecutive epochs, training is halted, and the model restores the best weights observed during the training process. The model also evaluates its performance on a validation set (X_val, y_val) after each epoch to guide this early stopping.

  <summary  style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold; display: flex; justify-content: center;">6. Model Optimization & Comparison</summary>
Since we have a little unbalanced data because of greate number of data samples under "Bitumin" class and lowest number of data samples under "Kanker" class the model trained will have a little bias. To prevent that we have preprocessed the data so that each classes have same number of data samples.
