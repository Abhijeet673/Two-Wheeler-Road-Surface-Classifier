# Two-Wheeler Road Surface Classifier

Two-Wheeler Road Surface Classifier is an Android app that captures accelerometer and gyroscope data to classify road conditions for two-wheeler rides. It collects motion data and trains an LSTM model to classify surfaces like Kankar, Bitumen, and Concrete roads, plus speed breakers. The dataset can also help detect rash driving, enabling real-time safety alerts. üöÄüèçÔ∏è

## Statement

Create an Android App that captures the readings from motion sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope) in an android phone. Build a dataset using this application that contains the motion characteristics of an average person driving a two-wheeler. Build a LSTM classifier that takes any 3 second sample as input and classifies it as Kankar Road, Bitumen Road, Concrete Road, Single Speed Breaker and Multiple Speed Breakers.

**_Bonus:_** Can we use this dataset to generate alerts when a person is rash driving?

**_App Development with MIT App Inventor to Capture Sensor Data_**

We need an Android app to capture and save motion sensor readings. Use MIT App Inventor to collect data. MIT App Inventor is beginner-friendly but limited in advanced features.

**Steps:**

- Create a New Project: Go to MIT App Inventor, log in, and create a new project.
- Add Sensors: Add accelerometer and gyroscope components.
- Design the Interface: Create buttons for actions like ‚ÄúStart Recording‚Äù and ‚ÄúStop Recording.‚Äù
- Save Data: Use the TinyDB or File component to save sensor data locally in CSV format.
- Export Data: Add functionality to send the file to your computer using email or Google Drive or do it manually.

We can use MIT App Inventor for this part.

**Prepare Your Environment:**

- Attach the phone securely to the two-wheeler.
- Select diverse routes (kankar, bitumen, concrete roads, etc.).

**Collect Data:**

- Start the app and record sensor readings while driving.
- Manually label the data or use a consistent annotation process during collection.
